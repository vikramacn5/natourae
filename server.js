// ======================================================= //

/*
  Unhandled promise rejections are errors that can happen in 
  our application but outside of mongoose or even outside of 
  the express itself. We need to handle those rejections by 
  listeninng to the event that will be emited by the process 
  object when there is a rejection in somewhere in our 
  applicaiton. So this is like a safety net like a last place 
  where the asynchronous errors will be handled at last if 
  they are not catched, this is like a global place we can 
  handle the asynchronous error. If we really have problems 
  connecting with our database then our application would not 
  actually work in c=that case we simply need to exit our 
  proocess but using process.exit() to exit our process is 
  really an abrupt way of exiting which will immediately abort 
  the pending or ongoing requests which is not ideal, so we 
  need to close the server first and that will take some time 
  to finish or process all the ongoing or pending requests 
  and executes the call back function and that is when we 
  need to exit our process. Exiting our process is not an 
  ideal thing to do so in big applications in real world 
  developers would develop a tool in order to restart our 
  application when it gets crashed or even some platforms 
  where we would host our node app would also do that 
  automatically.
